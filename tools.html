<h1>Artificial intelligence tools and platforms</h1>
<p>

<h2>Caffe Tool</h2> 
This open source tool - meaning it is available for modification by anyone - was developed by Yangqin Jia as a research for his PhD thesis at the University of California, as this tool specializes in what is known as deep learning in artificial intelligence.


<h2>Deeplearning4j tool</h2>
 It is a deep learning programming library written in Java language , and it is characterized by its ability to process big data, and like its predecessor, Deeplearning4j tool is open source.


<h2>IBM Watson tool</h2>
 It is a tool that allows its users to answer their questions with capabilities similar to human capabilities, this tool may be a source of assistance in providing commercial advice and optimal decision-making, and it protects the data of its users through encryption, and it is worth noting that this tool is only available in the English language.

<h2>Pybrain</h2>
 a Python utility that helps beginners in Python, and for those who are interested in deep learning topics and artificial neural networks within artificial intelligence, this open source tool is a library of what is known as machine learning.


<h2>Swift AI tool</h2>
 This tool can work on Mac devices, and will soon be able to support the Linux system , as Swift AI allows its users to process signals, create deep learning algorithms, or even create neural networks in the field of artificial intelligence.


<h2>Torch tool</h2>
 It is an open source tool for the process of scientific computing within artificial intelligence, and this tool is characterized by its support for neural networks in artificial intelligence, its ability to perform linear algebra operations, and its support for the graphics processing unit.


<h2>CNTK</h2>
 An open source tool that allows its users to combine different types of artificial intelligence models, and this tool has been developed by Microsoft.


<h2>Keras Tool</h2> 
The Python language was used to write this tool, which is a high-level library of so-called neural networks in artificial intelligence, and is characterized by ease of use for those who have knowledge of deep learning.


<h2>Scikit-Learn</h2>
 Scikit-Learn is one of the most popular AI learning libraries with which it is possible to extract data, analyze it, and visualize it.


<h2>Theano tool</h2>
 It is a tool that works within the Python work environment, and deals with various mathematical and mathematical functions and tasks such as matrices , and this tool is characterized by its speed through a personal computer; Not only does it use the CPU to do its job, it also uses the GPU along with the CPU; Fast execution of its orders.



<h2>Microsoft Azure Machine Learning platform </h2> 
It is an artificial intelligence platform provided by Microsoft, used through the cloud storage service, and enables its users to analyze data to facilitate business machine learning.


<h2>TensorFlow platform</h2>
 An open source library developed by the Google Brain team, in which information is represented as graphs, and each part of this graph is a specific piece of information.


<h2>Infosys Nia </h2>
 One of the AI ??platforms that is knowledge-based, then automates - automated - business processes and reworks its system again.


<h2> Wipro HOLMES </h2>
 A platform that provides its users with many cognitive computing services. To develop machines such as robots and drones.


<h2> Other AI platforms </h2>
 API.AI, Premonition platform, Rainbird platform, Ayasdi platform, Mind Meld platform, Wit platform, Vital AI platform, KAI platform, Receptiviti platform, Meya platform.</p>
