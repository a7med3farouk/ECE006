<h1>History of artificial intelligence</h1>
<p>
The emergence of the term artificial intelligence dates back to the fifties of the twentieth century, and specifically in the year 1950 AD when the scientist Alan Turing introduced what is known as the Turing Test,  which is concerned with assessing the intelligence of a computer and classifying it Smart if he can simulate the human mind.

One year after the Turing test appeared, the first program using artificial intelligence was created by Christopher Strachey - who was head of programming research at Oxford University - as he managed to check checkers via a computer and develop them. Then, Anthony Oettinger from the University of Cambridge designed a simulation experiment through a computer for the shopping process carried out by the human person in more than one store. This simulation aimed to measure the ability of the computer to learn, and this was the first successful experience of what It is known as machine learning.

The concept of artificial intelligence was officially announced in 1956 AD in Dartmouth College, but there has been no progress for nearly twenty years, and this may be due to the limited computer capabilities that were available at the time.

In 1979 the Stanford spacecraft was built, which is the first computer-driven vehicle, and in 1997 the first computer managed to beat a human competitor in chess ,  and the pace of acceleration in artificial intelligence began at the beginning of the twenty-first century Until interactive robots became available in stores, and even more than that, there was a robot that interacts with different emotions through facial expressions, and other robots that have become difficult tasks such as the Nomad robot, which carries out the task of searching and exploring remote places in the pole. Southern, and the location of met.</p>
