<h1>Types of artificial</h1>
<table>
<tr> 
<th>rtificial intelligence limited or narrow</th>
<td>is artificial intelligence limited or narrow a type of artificial intelligence that can make clear and specific tasks, self - such as cars driving, or even to identify programs speech or images, or a game of chess on Intelligent devices , this type of artificial intelligence is the most common and available today.</td>
</tr> 
<tr> 
<th>Artificial Intelligence General</th>
<td>which is the type that can work the ability of the similarity of the human capacity in terms of thinking, as it focuses on making the machine capable of thinking and planning on its own and is similar to human thinking, but there is no practical examples This kind, for all that exists so far is merely research studies that need a lot of effort to develop and transform it into reality, and the method of artificial neural network is one of the methods of studying general artificial intelligence, as it is concerned with the production of a system of neural networks for the machine similar to that contained in it the human body.</td>
</tr> 
<tr> 
<th>Artificial Intelligence Ultra</th>
<td>is superior artificial intelligence type that may exceed the level of intelligent human beings , and who can carry out the tasks better than doing human and has a specialized knowledge, and this type of many of the characteristics that must be included; As the ability to learn, plan, automatic communication and make judgments, the concept of super artificial intelligence is considered a hypothetical concept that does not exist in our time.</td>
</tr> 
<tr> 
<th>Interactive machines</th>
<td>The artificial intelligence of interactive machines is the simplest type of artificial intelligence; As this type lacks the ability to learn from past experiences or past experiences to develop future business, it interacts with current experiences to produce them in the best possible way. Examples of this type of artificial intelligence are Deep Blue devices developed by IBM, and the AlphaGo system of the company Google .</td>
</tr> 
<tr> 
<th>Limited memory</th>
<td>The type of artificial intelligence with limited memory can store data of past experiences for a limited period of time, and the self-driving system is one of the best examples of this type; Where the last speed of other cars is stored, the amount of the car away from other cars, the maximum speed, and other data necessary to drive on the roads.</td>
</tr> 
<tr> 
<th>Mind</th>
<td>Theory means that this type of artificial intelligence machine understanding of human feelings, and interact with people and communicate with them, it is worth mentioning that there are no applications currently on the process of this kind of artificial intelligence. Self-awareness: the type of self-awareness is on of the future expectations that the science of artificial intelligence aspires to, so that machines have self-awareness and special feelings, which will make them more intelligent than the human being, and this concept still does not exist on the ground Reality.</td>
</tr> 
<tr> 
<th>Machine Learning  </th>
<td>is one of the branches of artificial intelligence that is concerned with making the computer able to learn on its own from any previous experiences or experiences, which makes it able to predict and make the appropriate decision quickly, and that is through developing algorithms that It permits such an order, and it is worth noting that this term was first proposed in the year 1959 CE by Arthur Samuel Data mining``meaning the search and exploration of specific data and specific patterns within a wide range of data through computer programs, as companies can benefit from data mining in developing their performance, increasing their sales and reducing production costs.</td>
